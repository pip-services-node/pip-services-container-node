 * Todo: Rewrite the description.
 * 
 * Container configuration serves as a recipe for instantiating and 
 * configuring components inside the container.  
 * 
 * External configurations (stored as YAML or JSON) are passed to the container 
 * and define the structure of objects that need to be recreated in the container. 
 * Objects can be defined in two ways: 
 * - using descriptors (using which registered factories can recreate the object) 
 * - using hard-coded types (objects are recreated directly, based on their type, bypassing 
 * factories). 
 * 
 * In addition, various configurations are stored for each object. The container recreates the 
 * objects and, if they implement the IConfigurable interface, passes them their configurations.
